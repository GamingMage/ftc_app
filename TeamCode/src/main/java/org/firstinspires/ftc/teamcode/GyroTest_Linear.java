/**
 *  In order to calibrate the Gyro correctly, the robot must remain stationary during calibration.
 *  This is performed when the INIT button is pressed on the Driver Station.
 *  This code assumes that the robot is stationary when the INIT button is pressed.
 *  If this is not the case, then the INIT should be performed again.
 *
 *  The angle of movement/rotation is assumed to be a standardized rotation around the robot Z axis,
 *  which means that a Positive rotation is Counter Clock Wise, looking down on the field.
 *  This is consistent with the FTC field coordinate conventions set out in the document:
 *  ftc_app\doc\tutorial\FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
